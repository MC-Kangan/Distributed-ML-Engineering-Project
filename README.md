# Engineering for Data Analysis - Protein Prediction Project
> This project employs Amazon Web Services (AWS) to establish a distributed analysis system for running a 3D protein-prediction task. The primary challenge in protein prediction is the extensive time required for accurate forecasts. By leveraging a single AWS host machine to coordinate multiple worker machines, this project aims to significantly expedite the protein structure prediction process, improving the existing process's efficiency to facilitate relevant biological and pharmaceutical research better.
